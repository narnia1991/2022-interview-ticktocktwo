# Tic Tac Toe

## Story:

Create a web-based tic-tac-toe game using ReactJS and Typescript. If you do not
know about tic-tac toe, please refer to here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tactoe. Store/Save the matches into a database. Preferably (NO-SQL DB). This is a
two-player game but allow an option to compete with a bot.

- Store matches with player names, date of match, scores of each player and
  who won.

- Impose proper coding styles and component composition
- Having an API to interface with your database is a plus.

## TODO

### Good to have:

- - Undo Button
- - Difficulty settings
